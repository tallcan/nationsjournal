# ToDo

The items on this list need to be accomplished before the official release of Redux Framework v3.0.0

## Design Issues ##

* The 'px' tag on the **Styling Options -> Body Font** field is misaligned.
* Data-based checkbox and selects fail to show if no data is available. Ideally, it should show a single disabled entry such as '--No Data Available--'.
* Multiselect fields aren't showing complete placeholders (cutting off at 'Select an').
* I'd like to find a better theme for the date dropdown, it doesn't quite seem to fit.
* Fix responsive CSS

## Spelling/Textual Issues ##

* The **Text Option - URL Validated** field shows http://no-half-pixels.com, needs to be changed to http://reduxframework.com

## Other Issues ##

* Currently missing fields (at least in the demo) - raw HTML
* Add debugging info to Dev Mode tab
* Can we find a better place to put the footer_text content? Doesn't feel right now.
* Update sample options to show the correct facebook link, and drop LinkedIn
* Update sample options home tab
