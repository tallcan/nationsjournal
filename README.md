I searched, but I couldn't find a Wordpress starter theme that was based on Bootstrap 3 that I liked.  BREW is just pulling together excellent projects such as bootstrap, wordpress, bones, etc into a simple starter theme.  This is very lightweight with only some very mild CSS changes to make everything look nice out of the box.  My goal is to provide a solid foundation for anyone wanting to develop a wordpress theme with bootstrap.

Features:
* LESS
* SASS (thanks [garrettboatman](https://github.com/garrettboatman)!
* Bootstrap 3
* Bones
* sidebar and footer widgets
* Very clean out-of-the-box experience
* pagination
* breadcrumbs (just uncomment in the page templates)
* Font Awesome 


To use:
1. download zip and upload as wordpress theme.
2. set you variables at /less/custom-variables.less
3. add custom LESS/CSS at /less/custom.less
2. Decide if you want breadcrumbs (uncomment on pages where you want it)
3. Decide if you want Redux options framework (uncomment in functions.php)


To do:
* clean up custom.less
* Set up (just a few) options using Redux
